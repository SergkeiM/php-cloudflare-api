# Laravel

Once installed, if you are not using automatic package discovery, then you need to register the `Cloudflare\CloudflareServiceProvider` service provider in your `config/app.php`.

You can also optionally alias our facade:

```php [php]
'Cloudflare' => Cloudflare\Facades\Cloudflare::class,
```

## Configuration

Laravel Cloudflare requires connection configuration.

To get started, you'll need to publish all vendor assets:

```bash [bash]
php artisan vendor:publish
```

This will create a `config/cloudflare.php` file in your app that you can modify to set your configuration. Also, make sure you check for changes to the original config file in this package between releases.

## Usage

##### CloudflareManager

`Cloudflare\Client` is bound to the ioc container as `'cloudflare'` and can be accessed using the `Facades\Cloudflare` facade.

##### Facades\Cloudflare

This facade will dynamically pass static method calls to the `'cloudflare'` object in the ioc container which by default is the `Cloudflare\Client` class.

##### CloudflareServiceProvider

This class contains no public methods of interest. This class should be added to the providers array in `config/app.php`. This class will setup ioc bindings.

Here you can see an example of just how simple this package is to use. Out of the box. After you enter your `token` in the config file, it will just work:

```php [php]
use Cloudflare\Facades\Cloudflare;
// you can alias this in config/app.php if you like

Cloudflare::accounts()->list();

// or

Cloudflare::accounts()->details('ACCOUNT_ID');
```

If you prefer to use dependency injection over facades, then you can easily inject the manager like so:

```php [php]
use Cloudflare\Client;

class Foo
{

    public function __construct(
        private Client $cloudflare
    ) {

    }

    public function bar()
    {
        $this->cloudflare->accounts()->details('ACCOUNT_ID');
    }
}

app(Foo::class)->bar();
```
