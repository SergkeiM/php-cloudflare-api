$deployment = new Deployment('This is a human-readable message about the deployment');

$deployment
    ->setMessage('This is a human-readable message about the deployment that overwrites the initial message.')
    ->addVersion('version_id', 0.01);

$response = $client->workers()->deployments()->create('zone_id', $deployment);
