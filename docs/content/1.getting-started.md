# Getting Started

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for [CloudFlare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api), written with PHP.

## Installation

1. This package can be installed via Composer:

```bash [composer]
composer require sergkeim/php-cloudflare-api
```

2. Install HTTP Client

```bash [composer]
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

### Using a different HTTP Client

::alert{type="info"}
We are decoupled from any HTTP Client. You can use any other HTTP Client.
::

```bash [composer]
composer require symfony/http-client
```

To set up the CloudFlare client with this HTTP client

```php [php]
<?php

use SergkeiM\CloudFlare\Client;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttplugClient;

$client = Client::createWithHttpClient(new HttplugClient());
```

## Usage

```php [php]
<?php

use SergkeiM\CloudFlare\Client;

$client = new Client(getenv('CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN'));

$result = $client->accounts()->all()->toArray();

```
