# Versions

You can upload changes (versions) to your Worker independent of changing the version that is actively serving traffic (deployment).

:button-link[Cloudflare API docs]{icon="heroicons-outline:external-link" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/worker-versions-list-versions" blank}

## List Versions

List of Worker Versions. The first version in the list is the latest version.

```php [php]
$response = $client->workers()->versions()->list('account_id', 'script_name');
```

## Upload Version

Upload a Worker Version without deploying to Cloudflare's network. You can find more about the multipart metadata on Cloudflare [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/multipart-upload-metadata/).

```php [php]
//TODO
```

## Get Version Details

```php [php]
$response = $client->workers()->details()->details('account_id', 'script_name', 'version_id');
```
