# Holds

Zone holds prevent other teams in your organization from adding zones that are already active in another account.

:button-link[Cloudflare API docs]{icon="heroicons-outline:external-link" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zones-0-hold-get" blank}

## Get

Retrieve whether the zone is subject to a zone hold, and metadata about the hold.

```php [php]
$response = $client->zones()->holds()->details('zone_id');
```

## Create

Enforce a zone hold on the zone, blocking the creation and activation of zones with this zone's hostname.

```php [php]
$response = $client->zones()->holds()->create('zone_id', true);
```

## Remove

Stop enforcement of a zone hold on the zone, permanently or temporarily, allowing the creation and activation of zones with this zone's hostname.

```php [php]
$response = $client->zones()->holds()->delete('zone_id', 'hold_after');
```
