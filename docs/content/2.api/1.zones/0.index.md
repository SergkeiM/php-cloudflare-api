# Zones

Domains (or subdomains) that are added to Cloudflare become zones, which have a direct impact on the security and performance of your website, application, or API. Use your zone to monitor security and performance, update configurations, and apply zone-level products and services.

$response = $client->zones()->list('ACCOUNT_ID');
```

## Create

Create Zone for the account.

```php [php]
$values = [
    'name' => 'The domain name'
];

$response = $client->zones()->create('ACCOUNT_ID', $values);
```

## Details
