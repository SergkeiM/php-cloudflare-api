# Cloud Connector Rules

Cloud Connector allows you to route matching incoming traffic from your website to a public cloud provider that you define such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. With Cloud Connector you can make Cloudflare the control center for your web traffic, including traffic served from public cloud providers, without having to configure additional rules.
